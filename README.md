A standalone Student Management System Software

## Summary

Student Management System (SMS) aims to assist administrators, students, and faculty of a university in various activities related to their role. The student management system is established by the institution and its main aim is to manage student data. The software that we propose to build will provide limited features. Our student management system enables students to view semester wise marks and attendance of all the subjects. Students are required to log in to their personal portal using their assigned username and personalized password. Upon successfully logging in they are required to select the semester. After successfully selecting the semester they are provided with a list of all the subjects that they have chosen, students can then click on any specific subject and view their attendance and marks they got in periodical 1, periodical 2, internal and end-semester exams.

We wrote our software using JavaFX which is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich Internet applications that can run across a wide variety of devices. We used the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture.

Model section is used to handle all the backend data, which in our case are the student records, in the View section visualization code is entered, this is the section where fxml code is written and is responsible for the overall appearance of the software. The controller contains all the business logic including the transition of windows based on user interaction.
